#Objective: return the new distance between the rail such that the braking de-acceleration
#does not exceed 2.4G. Note that before the inflection point, friction braking will be used
#The braking force is based on the speed of the pod and the surface current density of
#on the rail, which is based on the distance between the magnet and the rail
